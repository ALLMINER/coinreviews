Heritage: Axis-ish, communitycoin, ECC

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Past time drift checking for block times is disabled. This can allow some timestamp and difficulty manipulation attacks
* MODERATE: Launch was somewhat unfair. Source was released later than binary wallets

Notes:

Good, has some checkpoints already

Odd. First miner appears to have been a private pool mining to address RArzZkA4G1u1cJpBkKLzU5sXwy2iCNvSMT.
This mining pool began mining about 1 minute after ANN. This private pool was extremely powerful, pushing difficulty to about 240 by itself. 
However, the last found block for the pool was 214, indicating it stopped being used soon after launch. 
The pool itself made payouts for the first time at block 52 primarily to RDUgnYPDUP4eLJMnmwLo5eimb8w7HQQhPR. 
There is no proof for or against this being a founder-run pool. It could just as easily be an early miner with an exotic setup
