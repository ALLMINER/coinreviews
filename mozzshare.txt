Heritage: bitcoin 0.8.5-ish (not 0.8.6 at least)

NOTE: This coin includes radical changes. This is a best effort review and is by no means 100% accurate. This is basically what I could gather from going over the coin for an hour

Problems:

* MODERATE: A lot of advanced floating point operations are used in protocol critical code 
* MAJOR: 9% premine for a pure PoW coin is extremely excessive
** wtf, the genesis block has been made spendable!? and with multiple coinbases!? 
* MODERATE: Looks like around 140 blocks may have premined. It's difficult to track down exact launch time, since they didn't actually announce it on bitcointalk


Notes:

blockchain appears sane, despite scary looking difficulty adjustment algorithm

genesis seed is a news event

Appears to be future plans for on-chain escrow somehow: (not implemented)
+    // escrow
+    OP_ESCROW1 = 0xc0,
+    OP_ESCROW2 = 0xc1,
+    OP_COMMIT = 0xc2,
+    OP_ABORT = 0xc3,

this is a bit misleading heh
                     else if (opcode == OP_SHA256)
-                        SHA256(&vch[0], vch.size(), &vchHash[0]);
+                        HEFTY1(&vch[0], vch.size(), &vchHash[0]);
