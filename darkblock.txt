Heritage: Mast(mastiff?)

Problems:

* MODERATE: Stake modifier checkpoints are disabled
* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event


Notes:

Blockchain analyzed and no premine took place. Mining began about 20 seconds after launch announcement

incorrect comment from last coin:
+// miner's POW block rewards (Note: 1st block = premine of 1%: 27068 coins out of 2,706,880 maximum coins in PoW period)

-    if (!CheckStakeModifierCheckpoints(pindexNew->nHeight, pindexNew->nStakeModifierChecksum))
-        return error("AddToBlockIndex() : Rejected by stake modifier checkpoint height=%d, modifier=0x%016"PRIx64, pindexNew->nHeight, nStakeModifier);

-        CSyncCheckpoint::strMasterPrivKey = strPrivKey;
+        CSyncCheckpoint::strDbloerPrivKey = strPrivKey;

-        if (!CheckStakeModifierCheckpoints(pindex->nHeight, pindex->nStakeModifierChecksum))
-            return error("CTxDB::LoadBlockIndex() : Failed stake modifier checkpoint height=%d, modifier=0x%016"PRIx64, pindex->nHeight, pindex->nStakeModifier);

I just spoke with the Darkblock Dev

He is making sure he has pools up for the launch so its a fair launch. Which I think is very good.

Twoturtles said that he might set up a pool for this coin a few pages back. 

He is the Neoscoin dev, so the Darkblock dev is currently in the Neoscoin IRC seeing whats up


I still havn't heard back for ocminer, so Im not sure if he is going to set up a pool or not.

The launch time will be sometime between 10am and 1pm PST, so there is time to get all the pools ready.

OP UPDATED! Happy mining!
