Problems:

* UNKOWN VerifyBlockSignature is commented out and disabled, and the network will not sync when it is added back in
** This is an addition that was added for Peercoin. I can't find any actual explanation as to what security it adds however. 
** It ensures that pools/miners mining a block actually own the address that mined funds are placed into. 
** apparently an upstream problem from a coin I've never heard of.. https://github.com/diemcoin/carpediemcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp

Notes:
good, sync checkpoint server appears to be running
good, genesis seed is news event
