Heritage: appears to be a "DDR" coin and a "drm" coin
Also forked from a "GB" coin
Oh, also forked from WEST 

Problems:

* MAJOR - Block reward in ANN is not accurate. It is 4.96 in code, but in ANN it is 10. 
* MODERATE - Afterwards, block reward drops very sharply and seemingly random
* MODERATE - Fees are said to be destructive in ANN, but this is not true. They go into PoW/PoS reward as usual.
* MINOR - Reward code uses floats, causing forks on non-x86
* MODERATE - Stake modifier checkpoints are disabled. This seems quite dangerous and even if an exploit isn't possible, will probably cause many fork problems
* MODERATE -The timestamp on the block is not checked to be too early. This could lead to difficulty adjustment exploits to scale down difficulty at a whim with a small-ish amount of hashing power.
* MINOR - The genesis block seed is not a news event


For reference, (seemingly insane) PoW reward code:

int64_t GetProofOfWorkReward(int64_t nFees)
{
    int64_t nSubsidy = 0.0000001 * COIN;
if(pindexBest->nHeight == 2)
{
    nSubsidy = 200000 * COIN;
        
}else if(pindexBest->nHeight == 3){
        nSubsidy = 10000 * COIN;  
} else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 2 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 1000){
    nSubsidy = 0.0000001 * COIN;
}else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 1001 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 41321){
      nSubsidy = 4.96 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 41321 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 202601){
      nSubsidy = 0.248 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 202601 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 242921){
      nSubsidy = 0.496 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 242921 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 283241){
      nSubsidy = 0.75 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 283241 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 323561){
      nSubsidy = 0.992 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 323561 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 363881){
      nSubsidy = 1.488 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 363881 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 404201){
      nSubsidy = 2.23214 * COIN;
   }
else if(pindexBest->nHeight > 404201 && pindexBest->nHeight <= 444521){
      nSubsidy = 3.2242 * COIN;
