Heritage: DRM, HACK

Problems:

* MODERATE: Genesis seed is not a recent news event
* MINOR: Alert key has not been changed. Network alerts can not be sent.
* MODERATE: Sync checkpoint key has not been changed. Sync checkpoints can not be used
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MODERATE: Actual PoW max coin supply is 1,536,750, not 2 million as in the ANN.
** This pushes the actual premine percentage to about 2.6%

4 extra blocks were premined that were zero-reward

Notes:

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, drm-like
