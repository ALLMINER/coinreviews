Heritage: SUMC, KEY, OPC

Problems:

* MINOR: despite somewhat signficant blockchain age, there are only a few early checkpoints
* MINOR: minimum difficulty is somewhat low, and resulted in some instamining. This was helped though with low-reward blocks (but didn't completely stop it)
* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event, but due to age this is probably not a big problem


Notes:

not sure if sync checkpoint key is actually valid

some crazy difficulty swings early on
