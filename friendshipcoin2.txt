Heritage: SDC

Problems:

* IMPORTANT: This is vulnerable to the recent OpenSSL forking issue.
** Please see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919695 for more info and how to fix this issue
* MODERATE: Sync checkpoint key is not set. Sync checkpoints can not be used
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints


genesis seed is not a news event, but with nearly(?) full PoS doesn't matter
Notes:

good, lots ofcheckpoints

is doing a coinswap from FSC to FSC2
