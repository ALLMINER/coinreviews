Heritage: ISIS, DRM

Problems:

* MODERATE: All checkpoints are completely disabled
* MODERATE: Genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Incapable of sending alerts or sync checkpoints, since the keys have not been changed
* MINOR: first 9 blocks were premined, yielding a 0.125% premine of PoW coins

Notes:

"//120 blocks for coins to mature gnome sayan" I've seen this somewhere...
