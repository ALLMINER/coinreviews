Coin Reviews:

These are reviews of various coins. Some I'm asked to review by bittrex, and some I do on my own. I do not attempt to review all coins, and all of my reviews are best effort. To do a full code review of a coin would take days. I typically only spend 30 minutes to an hour on each coin. So, I may have missed something, or mistaken a safe code for a possible exploit. The earlier reviews are particularly like this. As I've reviewed more coins, I've learned a more and made my reviews a bit more consistent. 

I also review only the source code, and sometimes the network (with a local or remote block explorer). I do not check binary wallets for discripancies or viruses.
