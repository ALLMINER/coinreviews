# Coin Reviews

These are reviews of various alternative cryptocurrencies/"altcoins". A significant portion of these were part of a subcontracting contract with Bittrex to review coins they were interested in. The other significant portion of these I review because the developer or community of the altcoin pays me to complete one, in order for traders and exchanges to feel more secure. Some I do for free because either I'm interested in it and with free time, or I feel it could affect the entire altcoin community. 

I also review only the source code and the network (with a local block explorer). I do not check binary wallets for discripancies or viruses. 

None of my reviews are 100% guaranteed to be correct. To do a thorough and complete review of a cryptocurrency's code would take weeks. I only spend about 1-2 hours reviewing each coin. A hidden issue has successfully made it past my review process in the past. I can't really do anything about this as I don't have weeks of free time to spend on every coin. I do try my best though to keep things fair and accurate and will double and triple check that an issue actually exists before publicly saying it does.

If you're a bit lost with my terminology, you can see the commonproblems.md document for an explanation of some of the more common issues with coins
