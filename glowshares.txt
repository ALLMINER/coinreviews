Heritage: ARCH

Problems:

* EXTREME: Currently the chain is at block 134 with about 7000 blocks to go before switching to pure PoS. Thus far, there are no PoS blocks minted
** The PoW difficulty due to this coin's design is extremely low and would be trivial to do a 51% attack on
** It will be safe as more coins are staked and the ratio of PoS blocks increases

Notes:

good, checkpointed premine
good, news event as genesis seed

note, there are coins with blockchain voting for reward and interest etc, but this coin is not forked from such a coin
