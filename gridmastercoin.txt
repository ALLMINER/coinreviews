Code Quality Grade: B
This coin has no serious problems, may have some minor network problems, and/or various other minor security issues. 

Heritage: crave

Problems:

* VERY MINOR: Premine not checkpointed
** The premine block should have a hardcoded checkpoint to prevent early miners from stealing it (accidentally, or maliciously)
* MODERATE: PoS sync checkpoint server is not running (but has a valid public key)
** PoS coins use sync checkpoints to enhance their network security by making occasional checkpoints in the wallet
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

Notes:

Before block 10080, zero-reward PoW was enabled which is a major security issue. 
The coin has now switched to pure PoS so this is no longer a problem. 

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, masternode, i2p
