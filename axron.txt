Heritage: NM (nightmare)

Problems:

* MINOR: blocktime is actually 80 seconds, not 75 as said in the ANN
* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event 
* NOTE: Total coin supply is actually 13 million(he cuts off PoS at that point), which is unusual. Total PoW supply is 1,800,000, making a 1000 coin premine very tiny
* MINOR: Mining started about 10 minutes before source release, but because of the fair launch 0 reward blocks, this doesn't really matter

side note: if this guy didn't have a 5 star PoD (and I verified it on cryptoasian), I'd say this was as Carsen coin
