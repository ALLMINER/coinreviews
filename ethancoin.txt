Heritage: DOGE(with PoS!? wtf), peercoin, novacoin
It seems some possibly deliberate action was taken to obscure it's origin. This being a DOGE fork would be extremely odd, and watermarks identifying 99% of coins as nova and peer forks have been renamed to "ethan" (though copyrights remain intact for some reason)

Problems:

* MINOR: Does not actually implement stealth addresses, despite saying so in the ANN
* CRITICAL: Huge premine of 21,000,000. With rough calculations, assuming 10,000 blocks of 10,000 reward(actually rewards are lower at some points), this would leave the developer with about 17% of the PoW coin supply
** combined with PoS, this means extremely strong network control is given to founder

notes:

premine of 21.000.000
