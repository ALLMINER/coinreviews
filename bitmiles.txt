Heritage: LTC 0.6.9ish, piggycoin template(https://github.com/piggycoin/piggycoin)

Problems:

* EXTREME: Premine is extremely excessive and will be more than the network will mint for over 2 years
** The premine being expressed as a percentage of the supply is deceiving, given that the full supply takes decades to mint
** See https://gist.github.com/Earlz/de3cc5f6ee85c7a69d53 to properly destroy a portion of this excessive premine

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

Watermarks: uint64, pow, unknown
