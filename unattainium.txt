Heritage: direct bitcoin 0.8.6 fork

Problems:

* MAJOR: 8 second block times is extremely dangerous. 
** An attack plan, and some details have been researched by someone else here:

** I've read through it, and it's at least mostly legitimate. I did not try to replicate this in a controlled scenario though, so I can not give a 100% confirmation.
* MINOR: Floating point operations in protocol critical code
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event

Blockchain could not be analyzed, due to no functioning seed nodes

Notes:

Random rewards are easily exploited by multipools. DOGE has proven that a multipool can easily switch to a coin when it is predicted it will have a high reward "random" block
