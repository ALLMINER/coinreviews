Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: ICO funds/premine was mined in such a way that PoS staking inflated the actual amount mined
** The ICO funds 800K actually ended up being around 800,600 coins.
** Can't tell how much BTC 600 coins actually adds up to, since I can't determine the price per coin from the announcement thread
* MINOR: ICO/premine funds have not been checkpointed
* MODERATE: The sync checkpoint key appears to be valid, but no sync checkpoint node appears to be running on the network
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

Notes:

genesis seed is news event

A lot of people concerned about PoS weight and amount of coins minted by PoS on the ICO funds. 
Looking at the ratio of PoS blocks and average payout, it's at most 800 coins.. probably more like 600 coins

Also some concern about moneysupply not including premine. I see no evidence of this unless github was updated before I could review it
