Heritage: almost identical to MEWN

Problems:

* MODERATE: minimum difficulty is set extremely low
** This allowed instamining of all 100 low-reward blocks, and about 50 high-reward blocks
* MINOR: Actual maximum PoW coin supply is 7,451,490, not 7,500,000 as in the ANNN
* NOTE: The premine is actually a bit smaller than specified in the ANN, at 0.67% of the supply
* MODERATE: sync checkpoint key is probably invalid and no checkpoint server appears to be running
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

Notes:

good, genesis block is news event
