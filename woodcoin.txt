This coin is based on a VERY old version of bitcoin/litecoin that is somewhat unfamiliar to me. I must stress that my reviews are never 100% thorough, and I may be wrong about some things or miss something. 

Heritage: ancient "foocoin" wallet template(https://github.com/razorlove-legacy/foocoin) which is from "barcoin" "Cryptocurrency that under no circumstances anyone should ever use, ever. Kthx, die."
smallchange (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=182430) "should by no means be used as a real cryptocurrency", litecoin 0.6ish


Problems:

* UNKNOWN: This uses the prime256v1 ECDSA encryption algorithm. This is known not to be a [safe curve](http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/), and the general opinion on the internet of this is that it is weak.
** I'm not a cryptographer, so I'm mostly going by what I see online. All coins use public key hashes (rather than just public keys) to safeguard against an encryption algorithm weakness also.
** also known as "NIST P-256"
* MAJOR: 304 blocks were premined and undisclosed
** Total coins premined: 1115320.21010626. Total coins minted over ~90 days:  6478991.3132145. Making premine about 17% of what the network mints in 90 days
** For reference, the early blocks have the most value, and block rewards go down with each block
* MODERATE: Intense floating point operations are used in protocol critical code. This may mean the network could fork off with non-x86 or even unusual models of x86 processors or compilers
* MINOR: alert key has not been changed from litecoin (or do alerts exist at all ugh), meaning network alerts can not be used

Notes:

As an aside, it's trivial to port a GPU miner to this coin. skein is part of X11 and so already has a GPU port, it just needs minor modifications

Chain will fork at block 15000 to adjust the difficulty algorithm. This is a leftover artifact from Smallchange
