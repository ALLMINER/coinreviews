Heritage: closely related to AXIS, perfect clone from XC X11coin or whatever the hell t's named now https://github.com/atcsecure/X11COIN

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: launch looks quite unfair. Many reports of compiler errors, and there was no post made at the time the wallet was released
** This is roughly confirmed by looking at the difficulty curve. Difficulty(and hashrate, judging by timestamps) doesn't really ramp up until about block 80. There is no way I can prove this was premined however. Also, some miners had wrong clocks and thus have weird timestamps, complicating this 


Notes:
