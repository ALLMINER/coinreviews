<h1>Code Reviews</h1>
<p>
My name is Earlz, and I do code reviews of altcoins. My primary focus is on security, not the feature of the month that each coin implements. For instance, I don't care about IRC or exchanges in wallet. Basically I compare the code of each altcoin in relation to a "known-safe" coin such as Bitcoin and look at the differences between them, and examine the network and launch conditions. 
</p>
<p>
My complete, but not always up to date, list of code reviews is at <a href="https://github.com/Earlz/coinreviews">github</a>
</p>
<p>
Some of the things I've spotted in the past:

<ul>
<li>Numerous undisclosed premines (mining started before public launch)</li>
<li>Purposefully disabled difficulty adjustment to enable insta-mining at launch</li>
<li>An exploit that enabled the developer to mine a block at anytime at will and skip PoW checking</li>
<li>An exploit that enabled the developer to mine a block with 1 billion coins (When the reward was suppose to be 100 coins)</li>
<li>Zero reward PoW, which made it trivial to 51% attack</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Along with these critical issues, I also spot minor issues that leave a coin in a state that isn't as secure as it could be. The way my reviews work is I give a list of Problems with a severity rating. Mostly anything that's "MODERATE" severity and below is not much to worry about. I do point out these minor issues while I'm looking though to explain that the issue exists and that it should be fixed if possible. 
</p>
<p>
If you are an investor or coin developer, I am definitely for hire. After I review your coin, you and investors can rest easy knowing that it is very unlikely for there to be a critical issue in the coin's blockchain. Along with investors being assured, this also means that various infrastructure services such as exchanges and markets can rest easy as well. 
</p>
<p>
My usual target rate per standard code review is $40. So, the price will end up being somewhere around that price in Bitcoin at the time you contact me. I accept bitcoin and in some cases a premine or coins from the coin to be reviewed. If you are about to launch a coin and want to make sure it's secure, give me a private pre-release wallet! I can tell you if there are any critical issues before release, and after it launches I'll check the blockchain and put up a review for it. I know some developers aren't malicious, but rather just make mistakes, and it's pretty easy to make mistakes in the complicated code that is the bitcoin wallet. 
</p>
<p>
I do not charge anything extra for code reviewing a pre-release wallet, assuming you will release it was open source. If you have a wallet that is closed-source, I do charge extra. It depends on what kind of stuff you have implemented and the reasons behind it being closed-source. Also I don't mind answering questions about altcoins for free (most of the time). The less shitcoins there are the better in my opinion, so if you're not sure how to setupa  sync checkpoint server, or how to ensure mining starts on time, contact me. I won't hold your hand through everything, but I'll make sure to give you a high level how-to and hopefully help you to understand things a bit better.
</p>
<p>
I can also do more advanced code reviews of features and such, but I charge more and it depends on what you want. 
</p>
<h1>Release</h1>

<p>
I must have all funds up front before I can start the review. Once the review is completed, if there are any critical issues then I must post it. Depending on the exact issue, I may first notify exchanges before publishing on the announcement page. This is to ensure that in the case of a malicious developer, the coin can be delisted before they have a chance to cash in. If there are no critical issues, I will post it immediately to the announcement. In some cases I may give the developer heads up a little bit before posting, to ensure that they understand the problems listed. 
</p>

<h1>Contact Me</h1>

<p>
To contact me for a code review or anything else, email me at earlz-AT-earlz.net, or ping me on Freenode IRC, my nick is "earlz". Please include Bitcointalk link (or any other announcement link), source code link (github/bitbucket strongly preferred), name of the coin, what coin it is forked from (if known), and any additional details that might be helpful.
