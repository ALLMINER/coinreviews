Heritage: similar to novacoin, probably related to https://github.com/cryptogenicbonds/CGB

Problems:

* UNKNOWN: Launch time is a complete mystery. supernova said they were up at 7:19pm, but first block after checkpoint is 7:59pm 
** If there was a premine, it was probably not anything major with the 1st 100 blocks being low reward
* MINOR: At least 71 blocks were premined. This yields only 71 coins however with the low reward blocks

Notes:

good, has checkpoint for premine and ICO
good, has news event as genesis seed

hopefully this is a safe value heh
     // The following combine threshold is important to security
     // Should not be adjusted if you don't understand the consequences
-    int64 nCombineThreshold = GetProofOfWorkReward(GetLastBlockIndex(pindexBest, false)->nBits) / 3;
+    int64 nCombineThreshold = 30;
