mistcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=826604.0

Heritage: "icecube" (iceburg?)

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: alert and sync checkpoint keys have not been changed. Sync checkpoints are considered somewhat essential for PoS security
* MODERATE: launch was not fair. Coin launched early with no advance notice given, nor post made on the bitcointalk thread to notify thread watchers.
* MINOR: Impossible to verify when the coin launched, but difficulty and time stamps indicate probably around 30 or 40 low reward blocks were premined

Notes:

bitcoin, novacoin, ppcoin, etc has been renamed to "mistcoin" (upper and lower case).. wtf

doge reference, but clearly not based on doge

-        block.nTime    = 1403927609;
+        block.nTime    = 1411001000;

this block time seems improbable..
