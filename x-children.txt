Heritage: vertcoin-ish

Problems:

* MODERATE: This is a short-term reward coin, but has no final halvening plan in place. 
** Difficulty will probably be dangerously low after the 4 weeks of rewards
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:

1 block mined early (with 0 reward). chain looks good

vertcoin is something close to this weird litecoin, bitcoin master-0.9 rebasing  with reqWallet RPC calls that's been baffling me
