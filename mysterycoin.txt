Heritage: DRM, WEST, HACK

Problems:

* MODERATE: PoS interest is actually 161.8%, not 16.18%. This might just be a parameter bug in the code, or a documentation error in the ANN
* MODERATE: although the sync checkpoint key is set, no checkpoint server appears to be running on the network
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

NOTE: alert key not set

Notes:

good, genesis seed is a news event
good, fair launch, mining began about 2 minutes after ANN wiht no premine

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, drm-like
