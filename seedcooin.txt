seedcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=795954.0

Heritage: shadowcoin (declared from github and verified)

Problems:

* MODERATE: checkpoints are disabled
* MINOR: uses floating point operations in protocol critical code


Notes:

Perfect launch, first block appears 4 seconds after wallets posted. Nice difficulty curve as well

genesis seed is a news event

ironically, seedcoin does not have any seed nodes hard coded, despit ehis own words heh

Ok, windows users: here's the password protected wallet:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/21yccfxu0njdxid/seedcoin-qt.zip?dl=0

Password will be posted at the very top of the OP at launch. 

If you downloaded the address wallet to participate in the ico, be sure to delete everything in %appdata%/seedcoin except for your wallet.dat. DO NOT DELETE wallet.dat. Back it up as well, just for good practice.

Nodes are hardcoded in the wallets so you wont need to add them to seedcoin.conf

I don't have the nodes on the repo though, so I will post them with the wallet password at launch for pool ops.
