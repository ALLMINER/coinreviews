Heritage: very similar to SPARK

Problems:

* MINOR: 1 extra block was premined, yielding an additional 400 coins (extra 0.03%)
* MINOR: Launch was somewhat unfair/obscured. Reports of windows wallet being released early, along with mining starting about 30 seconds early with initially very low hashrate. This affects at most 20 blocks

Notes:

good genesis seed is a recent news event from the day of ANN

Supply: 1,009,600
Premine: 10400 or ~1.03%

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, smsg, drm-like
