Heritage: bitcoin 0.10rc3, viacoin

Problems:

* MODERATE: Max supply in ANN is wrong. Max supply is infinite. 
* MAJOR: Expressing the amount of the premine in percentage of supply is very misleading
** Actual premine is 50,000 coins. This is equivalent to the reward of 1000 blocks at 50 coin reward, or about 12 hours of mining

good, genesis seed is a news event

Neat, has addrindex support

+    strUsage += "  -forcednsseed          " + strprintf(_("Always query for peer addresses extract DNS lookup (default: %u)"), 0) + "\n";

Also has checklocktimeverify

Significantly increased max signature size (ie, more complex redeem scripts and multisig setups), but max transaction size and block size are pretty small

Allows up to 120 bytes for op_return data

Bult in automated testing is useless though, as the tests are broken and all fail
