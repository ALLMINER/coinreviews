rootcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=714793.0

Heritage: very similar to bitstar, MNT

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: The first 450 PoW blocks had difficulty adjustment purposefully disabled, and as such about 500 blocks were mined 4 minutes after launch
* MAJOR:  Along with an instamine was some good ol' fashioned premining that started about 10 minutes before launch. At least 2 solominers and a pool
** 500 blocks being practically premined out of 10,000 PoW blocks is really bad
* MODERATE: "total coins" is not 3 million. Inappropriate assumption of MAX_MONEY


On blockchain:

blocks mined at premine time: 3 (ie, 2 extra blocks were mined)
blocks mined before launch, but after premine: 4-115 (from 00:00:58 to 01:09:39)

Addresses which hold the illegitimate premine: (notice, the pool with 1.5% fees) (there may be more addresses than this)

I don't usually dig into author history, but he also launched distrocoin
Interestingly enough has done a review like this of shibecoin some time back https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=595767.msg6572374#msg6572374


Notes:

This means the first 450 blocks are immune to difficulty adjustment, and so will be instamined:

lol wut (circulation_money is never referenced)
static const int64 MAX_MONEY = 3000000ULL * COIN;	    // 3 million total ROOT
static const int64 CIRCULATION_MONEY = MAX_MONEY;

we will release a status update and great news in about 2h. 
stay tuned!


ssdpool's block explorer sucks shit. It had might as well not be called a block explorer. and my local block explorer isn't powerful enough yet to trace out these addresses 

990 000 max coins mined from PoW 
44 550 coins instamined and/or premined
 1 600 000 premine (for PoI)
