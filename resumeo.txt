Heritage: DRM, xcloudcoin(?)

Problems:

* CRITICAL: PoW is currently active with zero-rewrds, leaving difficulty extremely low
** It would be trivial to conduct a 51% attack for double spending, etc
** There are about 8500 blocks left before the chain switches to pure PoS and this issue resolves itself
** Thus far, at around block 1500, there have not been any PoS blocks minted

* MODERATE: There is no hard
* MINOR: hardened stake modifier checkpoint support is disabled
* MINOR: The coin maturation (how many confirmations before you can spend coins from mined blocks) is extremely short
** It is set to just 5 confirms, with 30 seconds blocks is just 2.5 minutes
** Because of zero-inflaction, I guess this doesn't actually matter? 
* MINOR: The network alarm key has not been changed. Network alarms can not be sent
* MODERATE: The sync checkpoint key has not been changed and no sync checkpoint server is on the network
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MAJOR: By design, this coin has no benefit provided by staking coins (ie, there is interest is 0%)
** This will mean that few people will bother with staking, leaving the network less secure
