Code Quality Grade: B
This coin has no serious problems, may have some minor network problems, and/or various other minor security issues. 

Heritage: DRM (Dreamcoin)

Problems:

* MINOR: Alert key has not been changed
** This could allow for the developer of the coin whcih this was forked from to broadcast a malicious network alert
** If the intention is to disable the alert system, the alert key should be set to "0"
* MODERATE: PoS sync checkpoint server is not running and/or sync checkpoint does not have a valid/changed key
** PoS coins use sync checkpoints to enhance their network security. 
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MINOR: This coin is very old, but has no hardcoded checkpoints

Notes:

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, drm-like
