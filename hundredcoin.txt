Heritage: litecoin v0.8.5.1 (possibly a coin generator)

Problems:

* MODERATE: Checkpoints are completely disabled
* MODERATE: Alert keys are purposefully invalid, network alerts can not be sent
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: magic message string is set to the same as litecoin, possibly causing network traffic that is unwanted and useless

Notes:

Apparently where numbers are needed, random bashing on the keyboard was done
+static const int64 MAX_MONEY = 1553255906290448384;

Watermarks: uint64
