Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: It might be possible to conduct a DoS attack by spamming the network with very low difficulty blocks, and they would not be quickly discarded by nodes. 
* MINOR: Past drift and future drift is set to extremely low values. This may cause nodes with slightly inaccurate clocks to not sync properly 
* MODERATE: To easily run this coin daemon, you must run it as root. This is because it uses a P2P port below 1024 by default

Notes:

genesis seed is not a news event, but doesn't matter for a 100% PoS coin
good, plenty of checkpoints

This is for preventing DoS attacks.. the full difficulty checks are made at a later point.
