Heritage: direct fork from quark/coingenerator

Problems:

* MAJOR: The premine, though disclosed is extremely large and will be more than the network itself mints for months if not years

Original thread with launch details was apparently deleted(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=721398.0) so not really possible to determine any undisclosed premine with certainty. Judging from the difficulty and timestamps though, it looks like only 1 extra block was premined

Notes:

genesis seed is not a news event, but with the age of the coin, this is not a real issue

good checkpointed premine
