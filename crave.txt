Heritage: blackcoin

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: 40Mb block size with a 1-minute block time could make nodes and miners more likely to fork by a malicious miner broadcasting purposefully very large blocks. These require a significant amount of time to download (more than 1 minute on even a 3mb/s connection) and thus increases the chances of the network forking
* MINOR: Source was not available immediately at launch
* MODERATE: Difficulty adjusted very slowly at launch, with the first 180 blocks being mined in around 15 minutes, and block times not becoming completely normalized until around block 300

Notes:

Could not latest wallet to actually compile and work (libsecpk missing errors). Checked the blockchain with commit 040df8b6e45c1238033b6ded32ca226e83234aa3

good, no premine
good, has sync checkpoint server on network
