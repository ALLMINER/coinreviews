Heritage: perfect from shadowcoin

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event (appears to maybe be one, but is clearly ambiguous for our purposes)
* NOTE: launch was possibly a bit obscure, but everything was very clear by the time the fair launch zero-reward blocks ran out

Notes:

good, checkpointed premine

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, xxhash, smsg
