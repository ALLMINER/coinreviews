Heritage: forked somewhere between bitcoin 0.8.6 and 0.9, egulden-coin(https://github.com/egulden-coin/egulden), very similar to pyramidscoin

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event.
* MODERATE: Allowing mined coins to be spent after only 5 confirmations is somewhat dangerous. 
** This means, to conduct a "double spend", you never even need to buy/obtain coins legitimately. This can significantly reduce the cost and time required for an effective attack

blockchain seems ok. Exact premine amount not verified because it's difficult to track with how they mined it(over about 2000 blocks it appears)

Latest code is broken and prevents new nodes from syncing with old nodes, adding a ton of pain to get this going.

Notes:

Actually has an active testnet. A rare sight heh

Oddly enough, does not appear to be forked from litecoin at any point.
