Heritage: SYNC(https://github.com/MsCollec/sync/commit/150f9518586c6cd82d316e85ae0928abc71189e8), HACK

Problems:

* MAJOR: 1 block premined with high reward, undisclosed, and checkpointed 
** Reward of the block is 20,000 coins, or ~1.2% of the PoW coin supply

* MINOR: alert keys are not set. Network alerts can not be sent
* MODERATE: sync checkpoint key is not set. Synccheckpoints can not be used. It is considered somewhat insecure to use PoS without sync checkpoints
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Minimum fee is 0. This could allow flooding the network with transactions for free and also allow inflating block sizes

Max POW supply: 1,551,995
Premine: 20000 - About 1.2% (probably more like 1.5% with PoS blocks mixed in)
