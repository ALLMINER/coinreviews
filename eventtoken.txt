Heritage: SDC

Problems:

* MINOR: Some instamining happened for around 70 high-reward blocks. (mined in 10 minutes or less)
** This was caused by public mining beginning around block 60 and only having 40 blocks of zero rewards to bring the difficulty up

Notes:
genesis seed is not a news event, but doesn't matter for ICO
