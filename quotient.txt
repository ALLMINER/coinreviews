Heritage: probably SDC

Problems:

* NOTE: due to the PoW limit being a bit high (~0>>16, rather than the usual ~0>>20), there was some minor instamining for the first 60 blocks or so. However, mining didn't actually begin for over a minute after ANN, so doubtful that the founder exploited this
* VERY MINOR: Actual PoW coin supply is at most 1,615,536, probably about 5% or so less when factoring in PoS blocks mixed into it. This makes the premine slightly higher at around 1.0015% 

Notes:

PoW limit is a bit high
good, genesis seed is a news event
good, checkpointed premine
