Heritage: similar to LTCD, but not directly related at least. Some version of bitcoin in between 0.8.6 and 0.9. Not litecoin

Problems:

Notes:

blockchain looks good

one of the rare PoW coins with sync checkpoints

wtf loops do not belong in the reward code
+    while (nHeight > halvingInterval) {
+        nSubsidy /= 2;
+        halvingInterval += halvingGap;
+        halvingGap += 43200; // Next halving height gap is 43,200 blocks more than the last
+    }

This could probably help to locate what this is forked from.. this is not referenced
