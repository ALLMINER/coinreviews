Heritage: primarily bitcoin, amkoin(made by same person https://github.com/bryceweiner/amkoin ), franko

Problems:

* MODERATE: Forked in between bitcoin releases, in between 0.8.6 and 0.9.0
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not  a news event
* MINOR: Floating point operations used in critical code

Notes:

+CBigNum bnProofOfWorkLimit = CBigNum(~uint256(0) >> 20); // yes, totally sloppy.  Fuck off

+    // Franko: This fixes an issue where a 51% attack can change difficulty at will.
+    // Go back the full period unless it's the first retarget after genesis. Code courtesy of Art Forz
+    int blockstogoback = nInterval-1;
+    if ((pindexLast->nHeight+1) != nInterval)
+        blockstogoback = nInterval;

Despite being an sha256 coin, does not appear to be based directly on bitcoin
