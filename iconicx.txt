Heritage: MAST

Problems:

* MODERATE: Alert and synccheckpoint keys are invalid. Neither of these will be capable of functioning. PoS without sync checkpoints is considered somewhat insecure
* MINOR: proof of work limit is extremely low, allowing very fast instamining for the first 60 blocks or so. 
** Launch time is not clear, but given differences in payout addresses and block reports, there is probably no or little premine
** These were all low reward blocks, so this is a minor issue

Notes:

weird renaming...
-                printf("IRC name already in use\n");
+                printf("IRC name alreedy in use\n");

good genesis seed is a news event
