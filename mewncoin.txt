Heritage: SDC

Problems:

* MINOR: 11 low-reward blocks were premined and undisclosed, adding up to 34.54 coins
* MINOR: minimum difficulty is set very low, leading to some instamining that affected high-reward blocks
** The first 100 or so blocks were mined in less than 10 minutes, of which 70 were high-reward blocks

Notes:

good, checkpointed premine
good, very recent news event as genesis seed

what is this from?
