Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: 10% premine is excessive
* MODERATE: Minimum difficulty is extremely low, causing instamining to happen and first 100 blocks to be mined in 2 minutes, despite relatively low hashrate judging by the timestamps
* MODERATE: Launch was obscure and not clear. No notification was made that the coin launched at all, making the public code release impossible for me to verify

If not for the first 90 blocks being low-reward, I would accuse the dev of having made the launch obscure to quickly instamine a defacto premine. However, this is not the case and even if it was, the amount of coins gained by this compared to teh 10% premine is tiny

Notes:

Have to remove trailing whitespace from around makefile.unix:184 to get it to compile

a report of block count on bitcointalk is a bit of an anomoly:

However, my difficulty at block 19 would be 0.00000006. His difficulty and time of post matches up with
block 79         10/18/2014 07:13:29  0.16902095

So, either he's lying to say the coin is better, or trying to provide some controversy FUD... Either way.
