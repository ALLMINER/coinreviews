Code Quality Grade: A
This coin has pretty much perfect code quality, no apparent network problems and the only issues, if any, are minor nitpicks.

Heritage: crave

Problems:

* NOTE: Gensis seed is not a recent news event
** This doesn't actually matter though, because of the 1440 zero reward blocks makes a hidden premine practically impossible

Notes:

Good difficulty curve and launch seemed to have no problems

Someone mentioned on bitcointalk that the masternode implementation is broken. 
I'm not an expert on how the masternode system works and such, but I see no immediate problems with the code,
though I didn't try to setup a way to test it. 

I had to remove some non-essential code from listunspent() in rpcrawtransaction because it was throwing boost_serialization errors.
I'm going to chalk that up as just a problem with the latest boost (on Arch Linux) or some other compatibility problem between that.

Good, has running sync checkpoint server

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, getlow64
