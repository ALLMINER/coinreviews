Heritage: FIRE

Problems:

* MINOR: alert key has not been changed. Alert system can not be used. 
** If the alert system is to be disabled, the public key for it should be set to 0
* MODERATE: sync checkpoint key has not been changed. 
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MODERATE: minimum transaction fee is set to 0. This could allow for flooding the network with tiny transactions
* MINOR: Actual PoW max supply is 43,200,000, not 350,000,000 as specified in ANN (probably MAX_MONEY confusion)
* MODERATE: Launch was pretty rough due to no nodes being setup for this coin
** I'm pretty sure that mining actually started at 7:10, but it wasn't until pools got setup at 7:22 that the network had a node to relay blocks

Notes:

genesis seed is a recent news event as of launch(?)
