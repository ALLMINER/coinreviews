securitysyscoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=802430.0

This coin has a ton of extra features like block reward voting. Though, this functionality appears disabled, I may have missed something. I must stress that my reviews are best effort and with an atypical coin as this, I may miss something

Heritage: bitcoin 0.8.5ish 

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event (it's a news event, but 1 month old at ANN time)
* MODERATE: 1 extra block of 878 coins premined (at the time of ICO)
** a few minutes before launch, about 20 blocks were premined. All were by solo miners


Notes:

...wtf is this. insane difficulty adjustments on purpose?

+        printf("Retarget: **** securitysys Temporal Retargeting **** %d/%d : factor = %d\n",
+               count, (int)nLifeWindow/4, (int)pow(2.0f, min));
