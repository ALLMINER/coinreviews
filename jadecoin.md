Heritage: No obvious heritage watermarks

Looks like a standard clone coin made with slightly more dev competency than usual.

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:

* 1 minute blocks, so 6 confirmations should be fine
* Developer was actually competent enough to checkpoint the premine block
