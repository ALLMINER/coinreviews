Heritage: FIT
"We are used Darkcoin sources for base."

Problems: 

* MODERATE: network fees are 0, allowing flood attacks on the network and allows bloating the blockchain with no cost
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: slightly unfair launch. The wallets urls and such were not posted in a stand alone reply to teh thread. 
** This makes it impossible to track down the exact time of launch. The early block counts by early miners appear correct though, with well distributed pool of payout addresses


Notes:

reward scheme is confusing... ugh
