Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: no clear launch time announcement.. Mining began 20 minutes after the OP on bitcointalk. 
** If anything, about 60 blocks might have been premined, but it's impossible to actually confirm this

Notes:

Genesis seed is a news event

First 2 blocks mined are minimum difficulty
+    const CBlockIndex* pindexPrev = GetLastBlockIndex(pindexLast, fProofOfStake);
+    if (pindexPrev->pprev == NULL)
+        return bnTargetLimit.GetCompact(); // first block
+    const CBlockIndex* pindexPrevPrev = GetLastBlockIndex(pindexPrev->pprev, fProofOfStake);
+    if (pindexPrevPrev->pprev == NULL)
+        return bnTargetLimit.GetCompact(); // second block
