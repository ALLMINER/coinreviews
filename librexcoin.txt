librexcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=703042.0

Librexcoin shows no immediate signs of an obvious heritage. I compared it to firecoin, which appeared to only be a slight mismatch. 

I would consider librexcoin to be possibly secure to add. There is one problem that might be an exploit. I would need a second set of eyes with someone that knows the PoS system more indepth to know if it's exploitable, or just something removed to allow Zerocoin to work. 

Problems: 

* Minor(for security): hidden premine of 58800 coins. 84 blocks mined before relaunch officially announced.
* Minor: No github 
* Minor: Genesis seed is not a news event


This is the suspicious code removed that I am unsure about:
