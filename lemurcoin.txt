Heritage: darkcoin somewhere around v0.9

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Launch was somewhat unfair, with Windows wallet released before source code
* MODERATE: About 150 blocks were premined, yielding a 150 coin undisclosed premined. 
** Possibly less. Some forum postings appear to indicate wallet was released earlier than announced, and about 50 blocks were mined in the 1st minute after launch
* MODERATE: "Total coins", and thus premine percentage is misleading. 
** About 576 coins are mined per day. This means their 1,200+120 coin premine is equivalent to about 2.5 days of the network mining, which is not terrible as far as long term PoW coins go

Notes:
