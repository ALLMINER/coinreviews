Heritage: dream(drm), wildwestcoin

Problems:

* MODERATE: stake modifier checkpoints disabled
* NOTE: fees were not paid to miners during ICO period
* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: max block size is 100Mb, with 30 second block times. 
** This could allow for DDoS attacks with orphans and could cause big forks if a large block is accepted into the "primary" network, as high latency/low speed connections recieve this block
** This problem is also compounded by all transactions being free. 

Notes:

Recommended confirmations required: 12 (30 second blocktime)
