Heritage: shadowcoin (master, 3/23/2015)

Problems:

* VERY MINOR: Launch windows wallet was apparently broken at launch for most (all?) people, however source wallets were available about 2 minutes before mining actually began. 

Notes:

good, genesis seed is bitcoin blockhash
good, has sync checkpoint server
good, mining started at set time with no premine.


Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, lz4, sdc-like
