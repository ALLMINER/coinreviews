Heritage: bitcoin 0.8.6, blakecoin

Problems:

* MINOR: floating point operations in protocol critical code
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

stopped reviewing when I noticed that this wasn't actually a new coin. They put a link to the original announcement on the thread in liek 6pt font so no one would notice.. and they've never figured out github apparently so fuck it

Notes:

checkpoint in the far future? 	( 116419, uint256("0x000000006e3c1c93458ae8aa27c59e79391520be690e562836210a6e287989c1"))

wtf is this
+        if (nBestHeight >= EXPHEIGHT) {
+		std::cout << "Wallet has expired. Please update wallet";
+		StartShutdown ();
+		while ( 'm' != 'n' )
+			MilliSleep(99999);
