Heritage: perfect clone from shadowcash

Problems:

Notes:

good checkpointed premine and even stake modifier stuff properly checkpointed
good genesis seed is news event from 1 day before launch
good even copyrights for shadowcoin are maintained and not lazily renamed like usual

Mining began at correct time, 1 extra (0 coin block) mined but that doesn't matter

coin supply is correct and premine percentage

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, lz4
