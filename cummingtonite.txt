Heritage: RDD reddcoin
As an aside, apparently RDD is the only coin I've seen that is based on litecoin and is PoS

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event.
* MINOR: Premine is slightly wrong. Actual premine is 1.01%, not 1%. Max amount of coins is also wrong. It is 690,000
* MINOR: First 9 blocks were premined and undisclosed(other than the premine block), yielding 552 extra premine coins, bringing total premine to  1.09%

Notes:
premine is checkpointed.

Watermarks: uint64 with PoS, reqwallet rpc
