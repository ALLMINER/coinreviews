heritage: Stealthcoin

problems:

* MAJOR: Block reward scheme gives founders a practical premine when combined with a ninja launch.
** At least 1 block was officially premined, 2 minutes before launch. 
** First 35 blocks were mined within 1 minute from launch to the same address (first 30 blocks contained the biggest rewards)
** Difficulty adjustment of 30 blocks also makes this seem to be intended
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event


notes:
