Heritage: DRM(dreamcoin), AGS

Problems:

* MINOR: floating point operations in protocol critical code
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: premine is not checkpointed with a hard coded checkpoint
* MINOR: no clear launch time. appears that mining began early, but because of the 200 zero value blocks it's not so bad judging by the difficulty ramp up


Notes:

get the fuck on github. I had to wait 10 minutes before I could download the source
