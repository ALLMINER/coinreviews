Heritage: DRM, HACK

Problems:

* IMPORTANT: This is vulnerable to the recent OpenSSL forking issue.
** Please see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919695 for more info and how to fix this issue
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: The sync checkpoint key has not been changed. Sync checkpoints can not be used
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without checkpoints


Notes:

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, drm-like
