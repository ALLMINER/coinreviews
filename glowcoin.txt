Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: Time drift allowance is excessive at 1 day. For bitcoin it is 2 hours, for most PoS coins it's 15 minutes
* MINOR: 45 blocks were premined and undisclosed, but this is minor since the rewards were reduced
* MODERATE: Premine is slightly excessive at 5.4% of the total PoW coin supply 


Notes:

genesis seed is news event

premine of 172,000
maximum pow supply: 3,174,450 (possibly 10% less or so with PoS mixin) (simulated)
premine percent of 5.4% (possibly more with PoS mixin)
