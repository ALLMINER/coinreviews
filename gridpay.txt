Heritage: OPC

Problems:

* MODERATE: Future and Past time drift allowance is very large at 24 hours. 
** This can allow for timestamp manipulation and difficulty adjustment attacks
** For reference, most PoS coins make this 15 minutes, and bitcoin has it set to 3 hours
* CRITICAL: Currently at block 664, most blocks being minted are zero-reward PoW blocks, as such a 51% attack would be trivial.
** This will resolve itself as PoS blocks become more frequent and eventually PoW is disabled at block 5000.


Notes:

Because of ICO structure, genesis seed doesn't matter
