Heritage: AGS, DRM, HACK

Problems:

* MINOR: alert key has not been changed. network alerts can not be sent
* VERY MINOR: proof of work blocks could be minted slightly longer(10 minutes) longer than is actually specified by inclined miners
* MAJOR: PoW difficulty is extremely low and PoS is currently not majority. Only around 10-20% of blocks minted are with PoS
** This will resolve itself as funds are more distributed, leading to more PoS blocks and/or when PoW ends

Notes:


-    if (IsProofOfWork() && nHeight > LAST_POW_BLOCK)
+    if (IsProofOfWork() && (GetBlockTime() > LAST_POW_TIME))
         return DoS(100, error("AcceptBlock() : reject proof-of-work at height %d", nHeight));
