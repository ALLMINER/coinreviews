Heritage: SUMC, coin with foundation, OPC

Problems:

* MINOR: Uses floating point in critical code
* MODERATE: Stake modifier checkpoints disabled
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event
* NOTICE: Though it's intended, when combined with PoS, a 50% premine/ICO is somewhat dangerous for 51% attacks. They appear to be distributing all ICO proceeds now though, which will make this a non-concern
* MODERATE: The first 250 blocks have an absolutely broken difficulty adjustment. This resulted in about 200 blocks (~10000 coins worth) being mined in about 4 minutes. The "fair launch" mechanism was nearly useless
