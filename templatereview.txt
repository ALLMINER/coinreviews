Coin <bitcointalk>

Code Quality Grade: A
This coin has pretty much perfect code quality, no apparent network problems and the only issues, if any, are minor nitpicks.
Code Quality Grade: B
This coin has no serious problems, may have some minor network problems, and/or various other minor security issues. 
Code Quality Grade: C
This coin might have some serious problems that should be fixed, but is probably safe to use and not serious enough to prevent a viable attack vector. 
Code Quality Grade: D 
This coin might work today, but it might break tomorrow or have a serious problem that needs fixed. It might not be safe for use in it's current state
There may also be some intentional lies in the announcement thread about the specs or premine percentage. 
Code Quality Grade: F
This coin is a failure. It may or may not be capable of fixing the network, and there might be proof that the security problems are intentional. 
There may also be some intentional lies in the announcement thread about the specs or premine percentage.

Problems:

(common problems for template)
* MODERATE/MINOR: Gensis seed is not a recent news event
** This could allow for a perfectly-hidden premine to be mined on the blockchain before launch 
** NOTE: There is no indication that there actually is a perfectly-hidden premine, only indicating such a thing is possible
* MINOR: Alert key has not been changed
** This could allow for the developer of the coin whcih this was forked from to broadcast a malicious network alert
** If the intention is to disable the alert system, the alert key should be set to "0"
* MODERATE: PoS sync checkpoint server is not running and/or sync checkpoint does not have a valid/changed key
** PoS coins use sync checkpoints to enhance their network security. 
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* XXX: Premine amount posted in the announcement is inaccurate or misleading
* MINOR: Total coin supply posted in the announcement thread is inaccurate or misleading
* CRITICAL: PoW is enabled with zero rewards, despite mining having moved on to PoS
** This leaves PoW with a very low difficulty and double spending or attacking the blockchain in this state is trivial
* VERY MINOR: Premine not checkpointed
** The premine block should be checkpointed to prevent early miners from stealing it (accidentally, or maliciously)
