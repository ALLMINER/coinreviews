darktoken https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=785420.0

Heritage: very similar to FIRE, DOGE(wtf?), icecube (?)

Problems:

* MODERATE: Unable to use sync checkpoints or alert keys, since they are identical to FIRE (unless this is a Carsen coin)
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:

About 40 of the fair launch blocks were premined

doge watermark:
+const string strMessageMagic = "darktoken very Signed Message:\n";

same node IP as crackcoin

Watermarks: uint64_t
