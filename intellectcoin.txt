Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: sync checkpoint key is set to an invalid value, sync checkpoints can not be used
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:

Mining began around 2 minutes after launch. shadow_runner reported 2 blocks 2 minutes before mining began oddly enough.. 
This could be indicate a perfectly hidden premine (with modified timestamps), however this is more likely to be just a case of shadow_runner mining and then getting orphaned by larger hashrate and slow network for distributing blocks
