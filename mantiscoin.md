Heritage: DRM, DDR, WEST

Looks pretty much like a standard clone coin

Problems:

* MINOR: The "PoW+PoS" max minted in the ANN is misleading, since PoS rewards are actually infinite. This seems like a way to make a 2.5% premine sound smaller. Otherwise, the dev is incompetent enough to think that MAX_MONEY actually controls the maximum amount of coins minted
* MINOR: As mentioned above, the real premine is closer to 2.4%. (premine amounts are usually considered a percentage of PoW blocks, not of PoW and PoS blocks)
* MINOR: Time drift checking for future-drift is removed for accepting blocks. (possibly allowing some theoretical attacks, but many coins are missing this for some reason, so it's the norm)
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event


Notes:

* 60 second confirms, so 6 confirmations should be fine.
