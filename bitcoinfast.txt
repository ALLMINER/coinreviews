Heritage: communitycoin(perfect)

Problems:

* MAJOR: About 192 blocks were premined and undisclosed. This adds up to an extra 19,200 coins
* MAJOR: Premine is somewhat excessive at a bit over 1 day worth of mining. 
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:

Watermarks: uint64, pos, ardiano, axis-like
