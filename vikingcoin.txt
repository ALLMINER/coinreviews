Heritage: somehwere inbetween bitcoin 0.8.6 and 0.9, Devcoin

Problems:

* MODERATE: Forked from bitcoin master, rather than a stable release
* MODERATE: Genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: Is subject to DDoS attacks due to the minimum tx fee being 0 effectively
* MINOR: uses floating point operations in protocol critical code
* MODERATE: Was not also announced at bitcointalk, making the release obscured

Looks like 1 block was premined.. Difficult to confirm that though. Due to fair launch blocks, is irrelevant though

Notes:

how does this even compile.
