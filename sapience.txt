Heritage: quotient

Problems:

* CRITICAL: Although not obvious, PoW is still enabled (but zero-reward). PoW is of course at minimum difficulty (I mined about 40 blocks in 2 minutes with a CPU to confirm)
** This needs to be forked to disable PoW mining as there are still around 12,000 blocks remaining before PoW goes off right now

Notes:
genesis seed doesn't matter for ICO
good, checkpointed premine

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, sdc-like
