Heritage: 

Problems:

* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: Total money supply is wrong. I ran the random reward code through to 7000 blocks multiple times with a random number generator, and the average total supply is about 1.3 million coins, not 7 million as the ANN says
** This means the premine is actually about 4.8% or so of PoW minted coins, not 0.9% as the ANN says


Notes:

Cleaned up reward code:
// miner's coin base reward
int64_t GetProofOfWorkReward(int64_t nFees)
{
    if (pindexBest->nHeight < 1)
    {
        nSubsidy = 63000 * COIN; //0.9% Premine
    }
    else if (pindexBest->nHeight < 101)
    {
        nSubsidy = 1 * COIN; //1 Coin per block to prevent instamine
    }
    else 
    { 
        int rand = generateMTRandom(pindexBest->nHeight, 1000);
        if (pindexBest->nHeight < 7001) 
        {
            if(rand >= 990) 
            {
                nSubsidy = 10000 * COIN;
            } 
            else if (rand >= 940) 
            {
                nSubsidy = 500 * COIN;
            } 
            else if (rand >= 840) 
            {
                nSubsidy = 250 * COIN;
            } 
            else if (rand >= 690) 
            {
                nSubsidy = 100 * COIN;
            } 
            else if (rand >= 490) 
            {
            	nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
            } 
            else if (rand <= 489) 
            {
            	nSubsidy = 25 * COIN;
            }
        }
    }
}
