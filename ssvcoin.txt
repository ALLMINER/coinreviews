ssvcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=661043.0 and then community takeover to https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=736444

NOTE: This review covers both the original code and the community takeover code (they are equivalent, network-wise)

Heritage: AXIS (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=632818.0)

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: Max block size of 10M with short 60s block times. This could lead to more orphans and forks
* MINOR: "Total coin: 21 Million (POW 21 Million , NO POS)" that's flat out wrong. 
* MODERATE: Reward schedule is not correct, there is no third phase where rewards drop to 13
* MINOR: Acutal coin supply is not 21 million, it is 11,107,600 from PoW. This put's the premine at about 0.3%, not 0.2%. Another case of "total coins" being confusing
* NOTE: Two extra blocks were mined at the time the proper premine was mined. This is negligble due to the fair launch reward schedule. This resulted in only 2 extra coins being mined.

Notes:

All keys are the same.. which is untraditional, but not inheritely dangerous
