Heritage: ISIS, DRM, HASH, HACK

Problems:

* MINOR: Number of confirmations required before mined funds can be sent is slightly low
** This may enable some attacks to be slightly easier by using mined coins, instead of getting the coins another way
* NOTICE: alert key is purposefully invalidated. Network alerts can not be sent

Notes:

genesis seed isn't a news event, but for ICO doesn't matter

Public mining began around block 40 (block 2-100 is zero reward)

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, drm-like
