Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: Premine is excessive. 10% is for airdrop, and 7% is for promotions/whatever. Initially, they said there would be only a 10% premine
* MODERATE: ANN is incorrect. There is no max PoW block limit, and rewards continue to be 600 after 10,000 blocks. This also means there is no max PoW coins, it is infinite.
* NOTE: With the incorrect ANN and unlimited PoW blocks, the excessive premine actually isn't so bad

Launch failure!

Github was being difficult, we're trying multiple ways to get this puppy live. We apologize for the delay.

The source code is now live.

blocks up to 1690 premined with 600 coin reward, yielding about 17% premine. This also makes the premine difficult to track
