Heritage: APC(?)

Problems:

* CRITICAL: PoW Difficulty is currently extremely low. Conducting a double spend would be very easy and cheap to do
** This will be resolved as more PoS blocks are minted. Currently, it appears to be 100% PoW, with the last PoW block about 22,000 blocks away (no PoS blocks have been minted yet)

* MODERATE: Time drift allowance is excessive at 1 day. Bitcoin is 2 hours and most PoS coins are 15 minutes
** This could allow for difficulty manipulation by using excessively drifted timestamps
* MODERATE: Sync checkpoint key appears to be valid, but no sync checkpoint server is operating on the network currently
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

Notes:

genesis seed doesn't matter for ICO

-    uint256 hashCheckpointKnown; // ppcoin: known sent sync-checkpoint
+    uint256 hashCheckpointKnown; // apccoin: known sent sync-checkpoint
