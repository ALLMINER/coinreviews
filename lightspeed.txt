Heritage: 

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event
* UNKNOWN: The messed up Stake modifiers checkpoint might make stake modifiers effectively disabled

Notes:

Block chain analyzed and looks good

Everything has been renamed from lightspeed. ppcoin, novacoin, bitcoin, etc

How is this not completely broken?

 // Hard checkpoints of stake modifiers to ensure they are deterministic
 static std::map<int, unsigned int> mapStakeModifierCheckpoints =
     boost::assign::map_list_of
-        ( 0, 0x0e00670bu )
+        ( 1000000, 0x0e00670bu )
     ;
