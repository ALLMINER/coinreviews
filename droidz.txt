Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: Though launch was fair, the first 300 blocks was mined in around 20 minutes due to improper launch difficulty adjustment
* MODERATE: Sync checkpoint server is not running on the network
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

Notes:

genesis seed is not a news event, but doesn't matter for ICOs
public mining began at around block 42
