Heritage: direct fork from bitcoin 0.8.6. Looks to be a coingen coin

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: forking with a "time" rather than a block number is not completely safe, because block time can vary by +- 2 hours.
* MODERATE: Checkpoints are useless and/or how the hell does this coin work. It still has bitcoin checkpoints left in
* MAJOR: about 13000 blocks were premined. Oddly enough, some were mined in January, and then some in February, and then the rest a few days before release... No idea what was going on there. 

Notes:
oddly enough, testnet is removed
