Heritage: perfectly from shadowcoin commit d14445ebe670b5d29ff7e4895c63be264983e4d7

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: Premine is not checkpointed, but is probably cemented with a large number of PoW blocks
* MODERATE: Synccheckpoints and alerts are impossible to use, since the keys were not changed away from shadowcoin
* CRITICAL: Currently, block rewards are 0 and the chain's difficulty is extremely low(looks like 1 CPU worth). It would be trivial to conduct double spends, complete undoing of hundreds or even thousands of blocks
* MAJOR: Because of the extremely low difficulty, and no checkpoints (nor synccheckpoints possible), it would be trivial to undo the entire chain at this point with maybe a day of mining with maybe a $300 rented rig (ie, also steal the premine)

Notes:
difficulty of most blocks are around 0.002
