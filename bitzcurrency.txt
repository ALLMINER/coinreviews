Heritage: DRM, HACK

Problems:

* EXTREME: Very slow difficulty adjustment caused more than 5000 blocks to be mined in the first hour. Difficulty adjustment seems fine now, however. 
* MAJOR: Despite saying "no premine, no ICO", there was a premine of 4 blocks, or 140 coins. Though the amount is insignificant, this is a major issue only because the developer purposefully said there was no premine. 
* MODERATE: Sync checkpoint key has not been changed and will not be possible to use
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:



Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, drm-like
