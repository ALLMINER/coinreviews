Heritage: 

Problems:

* MAJOR: The first 6 blocks were premined and undisclosed. This adds up to 24,000 coins
** The address that mined these blocks went on to mine about 18 more blocks there were not before release
** The first six blocks were mined at 19:22, well before release, the rest were mined beginning at 19:54:04, very close or after release
** To burn the 24,000 coins that were premined use a proper burn address https://gist.github.com/Earlz/de3cc5f6ee85c7a69d53

* MODERATE: PoW minimum difficulty is extremely low, allowing for instamining
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a recent news event
