Heritage: SDC direct(probably)

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a recent news event (it appears to be a made up link?)
* MAJOR: premine percentage of 3.9% is somewhat excessive 
* MODERATE: There were 50 blocks premined and undisclosed, of which 20 were high-reward blocks.
** The amount premined is 40000, or an extra 0.05% of the supply

Notes:
premine and supply verified to be approximately correct

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, sdc-like
