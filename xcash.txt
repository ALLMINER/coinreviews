xcash https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=765360.msg8624319#msg8624319

Heritage: SDcoin, probably SSV(extremely similar source patterns)

Problems:

* MINOR: genesis seed is not a news event
* NOTE: In the ann thread, the dev mentions that you can mine to stealth addresses. This does not appear to actually be the case. There are still block checks in-place that I believe would prevent that
** also, the miner itself is still trivial and uses only public keys/addresses, as clearly seen with a block explorer

Notes:

appears to have character limit on transaction comments (or narations)
+        if (sNarr.length() > 24)
+            throw runtime_error("Narration must be 24 characters or less.");

all keys are the same: (this seems to be a new trend? )
