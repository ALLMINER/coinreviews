Heritage: bitcoin 0.8.6 

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Mined blocks mature after only 5 confirmations. This is extremely short and could make some 51% attack scenarios easier and cheaper to execute
* MINOR: RPC port and P2P port are not changed in the code from bitcoin, causing significant pain in getting the thing to sync, as well as potentially unwanted network traffic
* MODERATE: launch was obscure and not announced on bitcointalk at the time of launch
* MODERATE: 28 blocks were premined and undisclosed

Notes:
uses "mtgox is down" as seed. I'm pretty sure this is a coin generator
