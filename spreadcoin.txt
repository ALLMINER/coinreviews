Notes:

good, has checkpoints

genesis seed block is interesting.. guess that counts as a recent news event
const char* pszTimestamp = "Bitcoin block #312971 ~1cbec6ee63d173ea4b2c645cdb162aae6637170ecbb43c15";

has some stuff from motocoin, but doesn't appear to actually be forked from it

closest coin appears to be darkcoin v0.9.11.6, but still with tons of radical changes
