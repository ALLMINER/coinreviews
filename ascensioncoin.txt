Heritage: 

Problems:

NOTE: Max PoW supply is actually about 36,340,800 coins, making the premine amount actually about 0.6% of the PoW supply
** However, because of PoS running concurrently with PoW, this probably is closer to the ANN advertised amount of 12 million or so.

Notes:

good, genesis seed is news event
good, has checkpoint for premine
good, no undisclosed premine
good, has sync checkpoint server running
