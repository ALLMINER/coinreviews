Heritage: 

Problems:

* MINOR: Alert key has not been changed. Network alerts can not be sent
* MODERATE: Minimum PoW difficulty is set quite low. 
** This allowed for some instamining with the first 88 blocks mined in about 2 minutes 


Notes:

Early block report is wrong. reports block count as 32, but at that point actual block count for that difficulty should be 72
