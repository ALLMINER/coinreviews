Heritage: TC (techcoin?)

Problems:

* MODERATE: Sync checkpoint key is not populated nad purposefully disabled
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* NOTE: alert system purposefully disabled
* NOTE: stake modifier checkpoints purposefully disabled
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: Launch was very rough with no nodes being published until around block 400. 
** As a result of this, difficulty remained extremely low (CPU-mining levels for sha256)
** This potentially means that there is a defacto 400 block premine.. However, juding from difficulty curves,
   I'd say the premine is really only 100-200 blocks from this boched launch. 
** There is no proof that the dev has this "premine", as it could've been done by a solo-miner and orphaned the dev's early blocks (hence, mining starting hours after release)

Notes:

-addnode=95.215.44.248

Source released on 2/13 23:00. Mining began at 2/14 01:05. Probably due to lack of nodes
