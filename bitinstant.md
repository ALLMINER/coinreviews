History: Holy shit it's based on bitcoin 0.9, complete with the new build system.
Appears to be a straight clone off of bitcoin, with no obvious intermediate (100% sure not based off of FRAC, MEG, or DOGE, which is the only other 0.9 based coins I know of)

Actually appears to have a competent dev who knows how to write code. No problems found and is similar to how I would've done things. 

Problems:

* None!? 

Notes:

* Holy shit, actually uses a news event as genesis seed.
* Floating point used in reward code, but in such a way that's it's done at compile time, not runtime... so even that isn't an issue.
* KGW implementation seems to be greenfield
