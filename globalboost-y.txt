Heritage: bitcoin 0.8.* (something a tiny bit older than .6). very similar to pyramidcoin

Problems:

* MODERATE: new hashing algorithm. I can not find any peer reviews or info about the algorithm being tested thoroughly. 
** For reference, some details about yescrypt is here https://password-hashing.net/wiki/doku.php/yescrypt
* MODERATE: About 49 blocks were mined before the official release time

Notes:

First pure PoW coin I've seen with synccheckpoints from peercoin

Watermarks:
