Heritage: blackcoin v1.1.1ish... lots of commits rebased in and jumbled up

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: Founders own almost all coins. Because of PoS, they basically have full control of the blockchain. 
** They could do a double spend or any other 51% attack easily. If you don't trust the founders, then this coin should not be trusted

Used explorer.ethercoin.cc as a seed node. Because no nodes provided in the ANN, no DNS seeds, and IRC seeding doesn't work
Could not get PoS blocks to sync. It's basically 100% premined by design though

Notes:

IRC seeds was added back in, despite being mostly useless and unreliable
