microcoin 2.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=793538.0

Heritage: BITR, SUMC, OPC

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: time drift is allowed of up to 1 day. This could allow for some timestamp and difficulty manipulation attacks. 
** For reference, bitcoin only allows 4 hours. 
* MAJOR: launch was obscured. It wasn't announced as a new coin until half of the PoW blocks had been mined.
** Because of this, difficulty didn't pickup until block 2715
* MINOR: ANN spec for PoW coin supply is misleading. "5000 blocks with 1000MRC reward." actually, it's 4900 blocks with 1000 MRC with PoS blocks interspersed
