Heritage: ltc

Problems:

* EXTREME: Premine, though disclosed is extremely excessive and is worth at least 10 months worth of the network mining
* MINOR: premine is not checkpointed
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: At least 123 normal blocks were premined and undisclosed. This is insignificant compared to the disclosed premine however
* MAJOR: Due to very slow difficulty adjustment, the coin was instamined very heavily with over 9000 10-minute blocks being generated in about 36 hours
* MAJOR: Launch was very obscured. No source code was released for hours if not days after the coin was "launched" (ie, only Windows wallets available)
