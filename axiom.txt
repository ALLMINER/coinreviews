Code Quality Grade: A
This coin has pretty much perfect code quality, no apparent network problems and the only issues, if any, are minor nitpicks.

Heritage: 

Problems:

* MINOR: Alert key has not been changed
** This could allow for the developer of the coin whcih this was forked from to broadcast a malicious network alert
** If the intention is to disable the alert system, the alert key should be set to "0"

* NOTE: This coin uses a new hashing algorithm. 
** There is not necessarily anything wrong with this, but it has not been peer reviewed and battle tested for a long period of time as far as I can see.
** I am not a cryptographer so I'm not capable of giving much opinion on this, the core code had no obvious problems I could see though. 
** It's also been evaluated by some other people I know and determined to be secure by them

Notes:

Launch seemed to have quite a few orphaned forks, but otherwise seemed to work pretty well
