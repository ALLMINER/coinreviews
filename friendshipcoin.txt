Heritage: LTC (proclaimed and confirmed)

Problems:

* IMPORTANT: This is vulnerable to the recent OpenSSL forking issue.
** Please see https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=919695 for more info and how to fix this issue

* MODERATE: No checkpoints have been added despite significant coin age


genesis seed is not a news event, but with coin age doesn't matter at this point
Notes:

block 592 crashes my block explorer, probably due to some rounding bug with my code

blockchain not analyzed for premine due to realizing I was working on the wrong coin

Watermarks: uint64, pow
