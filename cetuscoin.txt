Heritage: communitycoin, ECC

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: The sync checkpoint key appears to be set, but no checkpoint server is running on the network
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MINOR: Despite significant time having passed since launch, there are still no hardcoded checkpoints

Notes:
About 50 zero-reward blocks premined

Watermarks: uint64, pos, axis-like
