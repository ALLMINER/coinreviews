sooncoin https://cryptocointalk.com/topic/27073-sooncoin-soon-sha256-pow-4minblocks-21-mil-total/

Heritage: sorta similar to joincoin, but with the multi-algo bits removed, ABC (proclaimed, but with a mix of many other codebases)

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MAJOR: Launch was obscure, with a fairly minor community launch in IRC and possibly Hashtalk (thread now deleted and dev banned, probably due to paycoin drama of the time)
* MINOR: Difficulty was very slow to adjust at launch, with first 300 blocks being mined in the first 10 minutes
** This is probably from having the minimum difficulty set so low for the sha256

Notes:

Because the launh is obscure, there is no good way for me to determine if there is any kind of undisclosed premine
