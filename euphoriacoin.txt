Heritage: SUMC, OPC

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Future and past timedrift allowance are excessive at 1 day (whereas bitcoin is 2 hours, and most PoS coins are 15 minutes)
** This could allow for easier attacks concerning timestamps like manipulating difficulty adjustments
* VERY MINOR: 38 blocks with very low reward were premined. This adds up to nothing though really. 
* MINOR: Launch was somewhat unfair. Though it's not the coin dev's fault, a pool with early source access began mining before the designated time
* MINOR: Launch difficulty adjustment didn't adjust very quickly, allowing for some minor instamining (ie, blocks mined in around 10-30 seconds) in the first 150 blocks or so

ASK the DEV 
Why the  CC pool  can get the source code in advance

This coin  must have some   dirty trick



The pools got the source so the code could be reviewed prior to launch. There have been a few coins lately with nasty code injected allowing millions of coins to be generated via POS. We wanted people to be able to be confident the code was clean.

Unfortunately one of the pools I gave the code to took advantage of that, despite agreeing not to start stratum until end of count down.

Thankfully, we had 100 blocks of 1 reward, of which we mined to 38 to ensure that the network was running smoothly.

Pools got online at between block 106 and 110, so only 6-10 blocks got caught by whoever mined early. In the grand scheme of 12k blocks I think we can live with 6 blocks instamined by whoever it was.
