Heritage: SUMC, OPC

Problems:

* MINOR: Floating point operations used in critical code
* MINOR: 200 extra 1 coin blocks are mined. Proclaimed to be "unused" and only for reaching PoS.
         However, this could've just as easily have been 0.1 coins or lower and accomplished the same goal of moving the PoS chain at minimum difficulty
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event


Notes:

blockchain is fine other than the extra 200 coins minted
