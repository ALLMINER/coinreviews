Heritage: SD, shadowcoin

Problems:

* MAJOR: Premine, though properly disclosed, is absolutely ridiculous. 
** After 1 full month of PoW mining with 10 coin rewards, the premine will still be over 75% of the coin supply
** When combined with PoS, this could enable double spend and other 51% attacks to be conducted very easily
* MINOR: Genesis seed is not a news event

Notes:
