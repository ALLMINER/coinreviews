Heritage: 

Problems:

* CRITICAL: Premine is absurdly large and will be more than is minted on the network with traditional mining for decades


Notes:

good, has a few checkpoints
good, has a news event as a genesis seed, though it doesn't matter much with the way the premine was done

This might cause problems for exchanges...
    if (dAmount <= 0.0 || dAmount > 84000000.0)
        throw JSONRPCError(RPC_TYPE_ERROR, "Invalid amount");

Blockchain not analyzed since the premine is so large that it probably doesn't even matter
