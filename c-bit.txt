C-BIT https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1374770.0

Code Quality Grade: C
This coin might have some serious problems that should be fixed, but is probably safe to use and not serious enough to be a viable attack vector. 

Heritage: Directly from Bitcoin 0.12.0 (self reported and confirmed)

Problems:

* MINOR: Alert key has not been changed
** This could allow for the developer of the coin whcih this was forked from to broadcast a malicious network alert
** If the intention is to disable the alert system, the alert key should be set to "0"
* MAJOR: The coin was announced first on an email list and an hour later was announced on Bitcointalk
** Although the email list was freely available for sign up, this is not what I would consider a "public" release
** This uses the naive Bitcoin difficulty adjustment, and thus did not compensate well for the initial early difficulty spike
** The end result is that about 6500 blocks were mined before the "public" announcement on Bitcointalk and elsewhere

Notes:

Weird search-replace error?
- -            return "node misbehaving";
+            return "node misbehabing";

Watermarks: pow, bitcoin, sha256
