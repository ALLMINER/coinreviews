Heritage: some bits of nova... but not nova

Problems:

* MODERATE: Future time drift checking is disabled. This could be used by a 51% attack to mint blocks of very low difficulty far into the future. 

Notes:

Mining began right on time and blockchain and difficulty curve looks good.

genesis seed is a news evetn

What is this?

ADDENDUM:

This coin contains a live exploit. This is similar to mysterycoin

Basically, the network protocol check that ensured the proper amount of coins were mined by each block was removed. This allowed a malicious miner to change the amount of coins mined and freely mint however many coins they wish. 

There is no real reason why I missed this. The diff for this coin had more noise than usual due to difficulty in finding the exact code it forked from. But looking at my logs of what I compared it against and such, the exploit was obviously there. I shouldn't have missed it, but I did. I guess it was just a bad time when I was reviewing it and skimmed over it. I will ensure that I remain vigilent in the future and to give each coin review the proper amount of time and attention to ensure this doesn't happen again. 

FIXED CODE REVIEW

ghostcoin-fixed  https://github.com/GhostCoinOfficial/ghostcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=803667.0

Change summary:

* alert and sync keys changed away from malicious dev
* Checkpoint added
* P2P port number changed
* Stake modifier checkpoint changed (it was probably wrong beforehand)
* LAST_POW_BLOCK changed so that they do a retroactive fork to PoS
