INCOMPLETE

Heritage: very close to vanilla ppcoin, mmxiv

Problems:

* MODEATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: Blocks 23 to 120 is purposefully set to have minimum difficulty, making instamining these blocks trivial

Notes:

+		if (!fProofOfStake && pindexLast->nHeight >= 23 && pindexLast->nHeight < 120)
+        return bnProofOfWorkLimit.GetCompact(); // most of the 1st 120 blocks

this looks like a (not security related) bug:
-    fs::path pathConfigFile(GetArg("-conf", "ppcoin.conf"));
+    fs::path pathConfigFile(GetArg("-conf", "mmxiv.conf"));

First ever coin I've evaluated with a code base so old that it doesn't include `getrawtransaction`. Because of this, and no usable block explorer, I consider this review incomplete. I could not evaluate the difficulty adjustment curve nor if there was any premine. 
I expect to update this review either when someone ports getrawtransaction, two independent parties throw up Abe based block explorers, or ports my local block explorer to somehow work without getrawtransaction
