mobcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=873867.0

Heritage: darkblock, librexcoin (perfect)

Problems:

* MINOR: alert key has not been set. Network alerts can not be used

Notes:

good, genesis seed is a fairly recent news event
Mining started apparently around 1.5 minutes after source was released

early block report is wrong
