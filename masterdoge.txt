masterdoge https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1105744

Code Quality Grade: B
This coin has no serious problems, may have some minor network problems, and/or various other minor security issues. 

Heritage: pharma (with exploit fixed)

Problems:

* MINOR: Gensis seed is not a recent news event
** This could allow for a perfectly-hidden premine to be mined on the blockchain before launch 
** NOTE: There is no indication that there actually is a perfectly-hidden premine, only indicating such a thing is possible
* MODERATE: PoS sync checkpoint server is not running and/or sync checkpoint does not have a valid/changed key
** PoS coins use sync checkpoints to enhance their network security. 
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* VERY MINOR: Premine not checkpointed
** The premine block should be checkpointed to prevent early miners from stealing it (accidentally, or maliciously)

Notes:

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, pharma-like, masternodes
