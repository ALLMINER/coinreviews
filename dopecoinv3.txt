Heritage: ECC

Problems:

MAJOR: Mining launch was VERY obscure. No details given about launch time, algorithm, source link, anything. 
** About 450 blocks mined with very low difficulty due to this obscurity, and of course impossible to even determine if there is a premine

Notes:

Some changes to PoS kernel.cpp that I'm not 100% sure about. looks ok, but not sure what the end-result functional difference really is

good, genesis seed is news event

Watermarks: uint64, pos, axis-like
