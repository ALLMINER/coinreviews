Code Quality Grade: B
This coin has no serious problems, may have some minor network problems, and/or various other minor security issues. 

Heritage: bitswift (developer declared)

Problems:

* MODERATE: PoS sync checkpoint server is not running and/or sync checkpoint does not have a valid/changed key
** PoS coins use sync checkpoints to enhance their network security. 
** It is considered somewhat insecure to use a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
** This can be fixed by running a checkpoint server with the sync checkpoint private key field populated

Notes:

Has good code quality overall
Interesting concept for data and services on the blockchain
Turboswift looks pretty good and secure
Fair launch method by enforcing a launch time in the blockchain seemed to work well
Has a recent news event for genesis seed

Watermarks: pos, uint64_t
