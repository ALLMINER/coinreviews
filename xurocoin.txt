Heritage: drm (dream), wildwestcoin, perfect clone from Utopiacoin( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=702380.0 )

Problems:

* MAJOR: Coin supply is wrong in ANN, actual supply from PoW is about 2 million coins, not 15 million.
** This means that their premine is actually about 6%, not 0.8%
* MINOR: Genesis block seed is not a news event

blockchain quickly checked, and no undisclosed premining appeared to have happened
