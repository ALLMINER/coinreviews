Heritage: darkcoin v0.9ish

Problems:

* MINOR: alert key is invalid and/or impossible. Network alerts can not be sent
* MINOR: 1 block was premined and undisclosed
* MINOR: although, difficulty curve looks good, digishield is designed to adjust every block, not every other block. This may cause insane difficulty adjustments with hashrate swings

Notes:

good already has a checkpoint

digishield is configured wrongly and will probably lead to insane difficulty adjustments with hashrate swings

Fun (not critical) bug exposed in my testing. If you start the the wallet the first time with -reindex, your local wallet will be stuck in a permanently broken state, rejecting all blocks

Early miner block reports seem correct, and blockchain looks good. no
