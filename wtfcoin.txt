Heritage: DRM

Problems:

* MINOR: alert keys have not been set. Network alerts can not be used
* MODERATE: future time drift checking is disabled. This may make timestamp difficulty manipulation attacks possible
* MODERATE: Minimum tx fee is 0. This could allow flooding the p2p network and inflating block sizes
* MINOR: Judging from launch time, difficulty curve, and time between blocks, it looks like at least 2 blocks were premined. 
** The address that mined these 2 blocks early, mined the first 20 blocks(until 10/20/2014 12:04:09 UTC), with somewhat low hashrate
** Exact launch time isn't easy to confirm, so this might be premined, or it might just be the founders mining the coin after launch

Notes:

stake modifier checkpoints are disabled, but there aren't any added anyway
