Heritage: proclaimed quark, "bitcoin 0.8.99"(never heard of it, and could find no coin)
Similar to bitcoin 0.8.6, but seemingly with a lot of things changed just cause

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: not announced on bitcointalk (this keeps a large set of people from hearing about the launch)
* MODERATE: a "coin" is based on a different measurement system. A coin is 100000 satoshis, rather than 100000000 satoshis. 
** This may cause significant infrastructure problems
* MODERATE: ANN is wrong "1,000,000 Total Coins" is not true. Coin supply is infinite and will in fact be over 5M before the first halving. 

No nodes could be found, so blockchain could not be analyzed

Notes:

wtf why is this even changed? 

 double GetDifficulty(const CBlockIndex* blockindex)
 {
     // Floating point number that is a multiple of the minimum difficulty,
     // minimum difficulty = 1.0.
     if (blockindex == NULL)
     {
         if (pindexBest == NULL)
             return 1.0;
         else
             blockindex = pindexBest;
     }
 
     int nShift = (blockindex->nBits >> 24) & 0xff;
 
     double dDiff =
         (double)0x0000ffff / (double)(blockindex->nBits & 0x00ffffff);
 
-    while (nShift < 29)
+    while (nShift < 30)
     {
         dDiff *= 256.0;
         nShift++;
     }
-    while (nShift > 29)
+    while (nShift > 30)
     {
         dDiff /= 256.0;
         nShift--;
     }
 
     return dDiff;
 }

 what the fuck...

-static const int64 COIN = 100000000;
-static const int64 CENT = 1000000;
+static const int64 COIN = 100000;
+static const int64 CENT = COIN / 100;

I really hope this coin generator never takes off. it's code is terrible
