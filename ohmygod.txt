Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: minimum difficulty is very low, allowing some instamining early on, including around 10 blocks with high reward
* MINOR: Actual POW max coin supply is 1,880,000, not 2,150,000 as listed in ANN 
** This makes premine about 1.4% (about the same as in ANN)
* NOTE: About 18 extra blocks were premined but had no rewards

Notes:

early miner with clock off by about a minute..

WTF, this post was apparently updated after the fact.. seems weird. The report comes from 12:47 according to the blockchain, but the post was made on 12:40
