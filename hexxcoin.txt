Code Quality Grade: A
This coin has pretty much perfect code quality, no apparent network problems and the only issues, if any, are minor nitpicks.

Heritage: crave

Problems:

* MINOR: Gensis seed is not a recent news event
** This could allow for a perfectly-hidden premine to be mined on the blockchain before launch 
** NOTE: There is no indication that there actually is a perfectly-hidden premine, only indicating such a thing is possible

Notes:

Launch looked good
Good, has a sync checkpoint server running on the network

Things appear to actually be implemented fairly cleanly, rather than quick hack jobs here and there
This may just be a remnant from whatever actual coin they forked from, but it's nice that all the parameters are actually in chainparams.cpp

Watermarks: uint64_t, pos, masternodes, pharma-like
