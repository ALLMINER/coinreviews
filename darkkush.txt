Problems:

* MODERATE: sync checkpoints can not be used, since the master public key is blank
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event (although has some newsweek reference?)
* MINOR: 3 blocks were premined (usually not a big deal, but with the biggest rewards in the first blocks..)
** Ends up being a premine of around 0.13% 
** The address that mined those premined blocks continued to mine 3 more blocks, less than 1 minute after launch
* NOTE: though by design, most coins are distributed to the people who got into the first 500 blocks, which were mined in around 6 hours. 

Notes:

Early block report of 66 blocks appears accurate. Difficulty curve seems good, first 50 blocks were mined in around 1.5 minutes, but that's to be expected 

There have been reports of the devs having instamined the coin and I can not see any conclusive support of this theory.
I personally know some early miners that have been able to get in on a ninja coin in about 1-2 minutes. The big instaminer 
began mining about 30 seconds after the ANN was posted. It's arguable that this is "impossible" without prior knowledge,
but also I've had dreams of setting up a program to automate the entire process for a typical ninja coin like this, which
could easily do the job in 30 seconds. 

I prefer not to speculate on mining behaviors and things outside of the code and network. So, I'll only say that 
there is no strong evidence for or against the instamining theory. This might've been the dev's private pool, this might've been a lucky early miner. It is impossible to determine
