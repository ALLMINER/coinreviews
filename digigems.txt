Heritage: litecoin master-0.8 c1e46ab3a90bd90b9092761214e841b165d4dbc8

Problems:

* EXTREME: At least 54 blocks were premined and undisclosed 
** This is an "extreme" issue because the ANN explicitly says "NO PREMINE"
** To provably destroy the premine use https://gist.github.com/Earlz/de3cc5f6ee85c7a69d53

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a recent news event

Notes:


Watermarks: uint64, pow, ltc-like
