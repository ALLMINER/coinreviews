Heritage: (silk reference, but not related to silkcoin), perfect from shade

Problems:

* MINOR: Stake modifier checkpoints appear to wrongly be using a 64bit number, not a 32 bit number... might lead to a stuck PoS chain
* MODERATE: Somewhat unfair launch. Reports of source being released after binaries, and the official pool before source was released
* MINOR: 2 blocks were premined and undisclosed


Notes:

For some reason, checkpoints.cpp has a ton of weird reformatting

Unknown why this is like this.. seems like it'll probbaly cause random problems

unsigned int GetNextTargetRequired(const CBlockIndex* pindexLast, bool fProofOfStake)
{
    return GetNextTargetRequired_(pindexLast, fProofOfStake);
    bool IS_POW = (pindexLast->nHeight < 10001) || (pindexLast->nHeight > 50000 && pindexLast->nHeight < 60001);

    if (IS_POW) {
        return GetNextTargetRequiredV1(pindexLast, fProofOfStake);
    } else {
        return GetNextTargetRequiredV2(pindexLast, fProofOfStake);
    }
}

fairly recent news event as genesis seed

Seems to be a copypaste error
