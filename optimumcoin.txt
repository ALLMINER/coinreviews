Notes:

not sure if alert/checkpoint keys are actually set to a valid public key...

this probably reveals partially at least what the direct fork of this coin is
            Send(hSocket, strprintf("JOIN #optimumizer%02d\r", channel_number).c_str());

Minimum difficulty is set extremely low... despite this, fair launch blocks prevented instamining
CBigNum bnProofOfWorkLimit(~uint256(0) >> 4);

good, genesis seed is a news event
coin supply is correct
Premine is about 1.2%, possibly a bit more with PoS blocks factored in
