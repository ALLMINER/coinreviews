Heritage: similar to shadowcoin, ethan, SUM

Problems:

* MODERATE: Any transaction is considered standard, this can allow for DDoS attacks on the mempool with expensive to process transactions
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: 86 extra blocks were premined. They were low reward however, producing only 86 extra coins

Notes:

good checkpointed ICO

Has that horrible wallet bug where syncing is difficult as hell to get going
