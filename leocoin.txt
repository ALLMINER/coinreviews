Heritage: 

Problems:

* UNKNOWN: No actual launch announcement can be found anywhere. There is no way for me to judge whether there is an undisclosed premine or not
* Judging by difficulty curve and transaction volume, at least the first 10,000 blocks were mined by very few people (probably 1 pool) and difficulty remained at a very low level (equivalent to maybe a dozen miners? scrypt-n knowledge is rusty)

Notes:

Apparently this was very wildly adapted to compile in Visual C++. 
Did not even know this was valid C++ syntax.. `(void)printf("...");`

Has a ton of custom code for various things.

good, has sync checkpoint server

Although is PoW+PoS, has some custom tuning so that PoS blocks are actually only about 10% of the blocks minted

Watermarks: uint64, pos, axis-like
