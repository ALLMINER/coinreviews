Heritage: somewhere around bitcoin 0.9.2

Problems:

* FIXED -- MINOR: Is vulnerable to a potential mining-shutdown attack, and will break spectacularly if a hard fork is ever made
** Fixed in upstream bitcoin: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4507
** Fixed in Fractalcoin (ie, can be merged directly): https://github.com/fractalcoin/fractalcoin/commit/46b5357182618015785309a5c3b3be1219e90aa9
** Also reported to dogecoin with confirmation https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/566

This coin has awesome code quality, and is done really to the books, it's just that it so happens bitcoin 0.9.2.1 has a small attack vector which impacts altcoins much stronger than bitcoin itself.
All BIPs are also enabled, which is nice.
