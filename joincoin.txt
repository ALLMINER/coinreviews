Heritage: A mystery version of bitcoin in between bitcoin 0.9 and 0.8(chainparams.cpp exists, but before the bitcoind/bitcoinrpc.cpp split)
Huntercoin, Zetacoin, Possibly Trinitycoin? 

Problems:

* MODERATE: Many algorithms are used, and algorithm weighting is not properly configured (what determines that a difficulty of 1 for scrypt is stronger than a difficulty of 2 for sha256)
** This greatly increases the risk of a 51% attack, since you only have to 51% attack the weakest algorithm.
** This also means groestly and scrypt mining is practically useless, since they are penalized far more than other algorithms.


Notes:

Genesis seed is news event
Has seed nodes configured, but they are not actually setup/the domain is not registered
