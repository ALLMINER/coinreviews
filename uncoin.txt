Heritage: MINT, CLOAK

Problems:

* NOTE: alert key has not been changed
* MODERATE: sync checkpoint key had a single-byte changed in it's key, rendering it a de-facto impossible key and disabled
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints
* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MODERATE: minimum relay fee is 0. This could lead to DoS attacks on the network by sending small spam transactions
* CRITICAL: PoW is still enabled, despite being zero reward and at minimum difficulty. This means PoW blocks can easily be minted very quickly and can 51% the network
* CRITICAL: judging from the PoW difficulty throughout the short 1000-block PoW reward period, this appears to be a 100% premine coin.
** The PoW difficulty has remained at the very low 0.002-0.004, which is basically a single miner worth with the X11 algorithm
** However, I see no actual proof of this, or any proof that more than one person owns any of this coin

Notes:

First block was mined 12/27/2014 13:07:34 UTC. No way to confirm if premined or not though without ANN.
