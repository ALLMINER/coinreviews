Heritage: 

Problems:

* MODERATE: genesis seed is not a news event
* MINOR: Around 50 blocks were premined, bring the premine amount to 1%, not 0.8% as disclosed
* MODERATE: No sync checkpoint server appears to be running on the network
** It is considered somewhat insecure to run a PoS coin without sync checkpoints

Notes:

Around 50 blocks premined
