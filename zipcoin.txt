Heritage appears to be a more exotic fork off of ppcoin, with some ppcoin watermarks renamed to zipcoin.(such as improperly renaming copyrights)
Also watermark from a "SUMC" coin is left over. Foundation (ie, percent of block reward sent to an address) code is left in but commented out.
Also appears to come from an "OPC" and "KEY" coin.

Really stupid code was left in that forces miners to attach 2 outputs(1 to the miner address, and 1 to NULL) to a generation transaction. However, this seems harmless other than adding a tiny bit of bloat and stupidity. 

The Announcement is wrong. PoS is already active and actively being used, as seen here: http://explorer.zip.altpooler.com/tx/3ed835401d0a624f1a9f2465c59d4a8d077f4a1e29f7194a860012cd9658a00e#o1 (that address is the first block mined, so is probably the founder). The code responsible for this is:

-    if (IsProofOfStake() && nHeight < MODIFIER_INTERVAL_SWITCH)
-        return DoS(100, error("AcceptBlock() : reject proof-of-stake at height %d", nHeight));
-


Also, the block explorer that is currently setup does not appear to be setup for PoS. See these negative fees http://explorer.zip.altpooler.com/block/3b9d2668ae7da1df27ff6496779169ee7c15d7df1b4db71a45867979c9a10ce5

Despite the amount of stupid code and unintentional almost-exploits, I believe the network should be secure and act as expected, other than PoS already being active
