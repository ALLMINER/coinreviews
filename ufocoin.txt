Heritage: perfect from litecoin v0.8.6.9 (proclaimed)

Problems:

* MINOR: Premine at the time (unless it was an IPO, which I can't find profo of) was a bit excessive, however, it is less than 1% of the coin supply now
* NOTE: genesis seed is not a news event (but so old and with checkpoints that it doesn't matter)

Notes:

good, plenty of checkpoints

blockchain not analyzed due to the relatively little info that would be gained by such an old coin (also, after 45 minutes it still wasn't done syncing)

Watermarks: uint64, pow, synccheckpoints
