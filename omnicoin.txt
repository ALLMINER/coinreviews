Heritage: luckycoin

Problems:

* MAJOR: First 144 blocks are fixed at a minimum difficulty
** This allowed the first 144 blocks to be mined in around 5 minutes
* NOTE: Genesis seed is not a news event
** due to coin age, this probably doesn't matter anymore
* MODERATE: Launch was somewhat obscure. This makes it impossible to determine when mining started exactly and if there was a premine

Notes:

Watermarks: uint64, pow, coincontrol, reqwallet, unknown/cross PYRA/LTC-like
